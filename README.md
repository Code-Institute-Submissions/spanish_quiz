## Introduction
The organisers of Dublin Intercambio wanted to create an additional learning resource for the people that attend their language
exchanges.  They know that building vocabulary is a key element to improving your fluency of the language. They have created a bank of 
questions based on converstaions they have with the language exchange participants, when they overhear participants commenting on a new
word they have learned as well as adding their own interestings words or phrases that you won't find in a text book.

## Scope 

Create a simple, intuitive, and responsive website that hosts a quiz to help their participants learn and provided another way to advertise their intercambio events. 

The site should be no more than 4 pages with the focus being the quiz to provide a simple, fun and intuative to use, language learning tool.  

The structure should adhere to convetion and be simple and intuitive, ensuring the user always knows where they are, how they got there and how to get back to 
where they started.

The design should be similar to the Dublin Intercambio website, utilising the same colour palette, however as the focus is the quiz there will be no images used in this site, this will help to
focus the users attention in the questions and answers.

Any addition features or functionaly are out of scope at this stage.

User goals:
* To enhance their Spanish vocabulary
* To find out how to take part in a language exchange
* To improve their language skills

Website owers goals:
* To create a fun and interactive quiz with no errors
* To provide a free learning tool to their intercambio attendees and the wider public
* To provide a way for users to interact with the organisers
* To use the free quiz to further advertise their intercambio events
 
## UX

#### User stories

##### A typical user of this site would:
* Have an interest in improving their level of Spanish
* 
* 

##### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:
* The vocabulary and frases used in this quiz are based on real conversations that happen in our intercambios instead of the standard vocabulary you find in text books.
* Users can submit their own suggestions for words or questions to add to the question bank, interesting words they recently learned, or interesting frases.
* The Spanish Quiz website:
    * Is easy to navigate.
    * Is part of the Dublin Intercambio community and as such has a warm, friendly and inviting feel to it.
    * Ensures the important information is easy to find and access.
    * Encourages users to attend the events and get involved.

### Design (Wireframes and Mockups): 
With this site, I wanted to keep the design very simple, and create a connection with the [Dublin Intercambio](https://donnaib.github.io/dublin_intercambio/) site by utilising the same color pallete.
As I always like to do I began the process of creating wireframes with good old fashioned pen and paper to get a very rough skeleton of the site based on the best layout for the required functionality.

With a basic sketch created I moved to Balsamiq to create more detailed Wireframes for the site.
