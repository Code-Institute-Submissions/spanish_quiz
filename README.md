## Introduction
The organisers of Dublin Intercambio wanted to create an additional learning resource for the people that attend their language
exchanges.  They know that building vocabulary is a key element to improving your fluency of the language. They have created a bank of 
questions based on converstaions they have with the language exchange participants, when they overhear participants commenting on a new
word they have learned as well as adding their own interestings words or phrases that you won't find in a text book.

## Scope 

Create a simple, intuitive, and responsive website that hosts a quiz to help their participants learn and provided another way to advertise their intercambio events. 
The site should be no more than 4 pages with the focus being the quiz to provide a simple, fun and intuative to use, language learning tool.  

The structure should adhere to convetion and be simple and intuitive, ensuring the user always knows where they are, how they got there and how to get back to 
where they started.

The design should be similar to the Dublin Intercambio website, utilising the same colour palette, however as the focus is the quiz there will be no images used in this site, this will help to
focus the users attention in the questions and answers.

Any addition features or functionaly are out of scope at this stage.
